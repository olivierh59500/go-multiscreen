# DCK version

This directory contains the construction-kit version of go-multiscreen. The original Go sources are preserved at their original paths (revision `2cd2bc12a9df9509ba3b3313c2b14543c3a97acc`), with small asset accessors so both versions use the same embedded resources.

Run the original with `go run ./cmd/multiscreen` and this version with `go run ./dck/cmd/multiscreen` from the repository root.

The choreography and assets stay local; reusable rendering and effects live in `../../lib/democonstructionkit`. Second Reality retains its original ST3 music synchronization.
